# WAI-ARIA: Authoring Practices Guide

## Code conformance

* All code should validate in the NU HTML Validator. Exceptions to this rule are warnings and errors related to future ARIA features we need to implement.
* To keep code in this repository consistent; editors should use a text editor that supports [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).
* It is encouraged to place an element's attributes on separate lines; this is much easier to navigate for everyone.
