### Code conformance

* All code should validate in the NU HTML Validator.
Exceptions to this rule are warnings and errors related to
future ARIA features we need to implement.
* To keep code in this repository consistent; editors should use a text editor
that supports [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).
* It is encouraged to keep line lengths under 80 characters;
this is much easier to navigate for everyone.
